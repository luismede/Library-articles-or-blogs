# About this project
The website ideia is: "How about bringing together multiple articles, blogs, news, troubleshooting and more on one site?"

**Note:** The website code is unlimited! I chose articles as the main topic. But if you wish, you can change it to your theme.

The site was not hosted on any hosting. But for testing I started the server on my localhost and started ngrok to have a public link.

#### Important observations:
**1** - I did not program the password recovery option, although it appears in the login option. üòâ

**2** - The image upload is not connected to firebase storage, so the images are being uploaded on your machine in the uploads/ folder. üóÇÔ∏è
